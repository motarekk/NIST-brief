This is my brief about the NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF), that I have studied in the LCSPC Certification (Lead Cyber Security Professional Certified) from Certiprof:

Cyber Security Framework (CSF), published by the NIST, is an adaptive risk-based approach to improve cyber risk management of the critical infrastructure organizations. It consists of the core functions, implementation tiers, and profiles. The Core includes the outcomes, which are the categories and sub-categories of the main functions aligned with references of international standards, guidelines, and best practices. Implementation tiers measures how an organization exhibits the cybersecurity risks and the cyber activities to manage those risks. It describes the level of an organizationâ€™s practices in obtaining the risk management process and the external participation. External participation includes receiving information such as threat intelligence, best practices and technologies from other entities such as buyers, suppliers, dependencies, dependents, ISAOs, ISACs, researchers, partners and governments.
A Profile is the alignment of the Functions, Categories, and Subcategories with the business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the organization. An organization can use this framework to create the current-state profile, which represents the current cybersecurity posture, depending on achieving the outcomes of the core functions in the framework. After that they can create the target profile, which is prioritized list of organizational cybersecurity requirements, depending on business/mission drivers, resources, changes in threat and technology landscape, and organizational objectives. After that, they start to prioritize the cyber activities implemented to fill the gaps between the current profile and the target profile, depending on the risk tolerance and changing business requirements. Finally, they can determine their cybersecurity risk management level depending on the implementation tires. From there, they keep the process of reassessment of the risk and improving their profile.
This risk-based approach enables an organization to create a prioritized roadmap and gauge the resources needed such as staffing and funding to achieve cybersecurity goals in a cost-effective, prioritized manner.
 
NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF):
CORE:
identify = understand what assets you have in the organization.
protect = figure out how you're going to defend these assets.
detect = continuous monitoring for breaches and different types of infiltration that maybe happening.
respond = looking for ways to respond when a breach happens.
recover = be able to get your business back up and running 100% after a breach has happened. (BCP - DRP)

PROFILES:
- Target profile
- Current profile
- Gap analysis

IMPLEMENTATION TIERS:
1- Partial
 2- Risk Informed
 3- Repeatable
 4- Adaptive
